# TensorFlow Beginner Project

This is a beginner-level TensorFlow project consisting of two Jupyter notebooks: one for regression and another for classification tasks. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of using TensorFlow for machine learning.

## Project Structure

- `01_neural_network_regression_in_tensorflow.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for a regression task.
- `02_neural_network_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for a classification task.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- TensorFlow (2.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install TensorFlow and Jupyter Notebook using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install jupyter
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tensorflow-beginner-project.git
cd tensorflow-beginner-project
```

2. Open Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Navigate to the `01_neural_network_regression_in_tensorflow.ipynb` or `02_neural_network_classification.ipynb` notebook, depending on your task.

4. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to execute the TensorFlow code.

## Notebooks Overview

- `01_neural_network_regression_in_tensorflow.ipynb`:

  - Demonstrates how to use TensorFlow for a regression task.
  - Includes data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

- `02_neural_network_classification.ipynb`:
  - Demonstrates how to use TensorFlow for a classification task.
  - Includes data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Usage

Feel free to use these notebooks as a learning resource or as a starting point for your own machine learning projects. Experiment with different datasets, hyperparameters, and models to further your understanding of TensorFlow.
